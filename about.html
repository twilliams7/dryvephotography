    <h3><u>Options, Specs and Mods-</u></h3>
<li>Guards Red Paint</li>
<li>18” Factory Carrera Alloys which look absolutely amazing.</li>
<li>Colored Porsche logo center wheel caps, Porsche logo on shift handle, more Porsche crap, etc.<br>
<li>Bose premium audio system</li>
<li>All-aluminum look interior (steering wheel, center console, shift knob, parking brake, door handles, etc.) and it has the most factory aluminum finish I've ever seen in a 986.</li>
<li>Don’t think it is an option, but metropol blue (navy) top and interior. Super hard to find red/navy from my experience.</li>
<li>Running Michelin Pilot Super Sports right now, car came with Eagle F1s but they were cupping.</li>
<li>Factory Sport Kit bumpers and lips</li>
<li>Brembo brakes with red colored Porsche calipers</li>
<li>De-ambered the front and rear lights. Plan to add Macan style LED projectors to the headlights this summer. (DONE!)</li>
<li>Hella smoked side markers</li>
<li>Porsche Performance Sport Exhaust System (PSE) which sounds and looks absolutely amazing… The best burble ever from a six cylinder.</li>
<li>Replaced front and rear control arms (because of a rattle from the back, but car also drives much stiffer and “handles like it’s on rails”, as I always say.)</li>
<li>Replaced rear wheel bearings because of the same rattle. Rattle is gone!</li>
<li>It had an aftermarket 12 disc CD changer, but it's now obsolete... so we took it out for a little more trunk space.</li>
<li>Added an integrated Bluetooth receiver into the car to use with your phone. Not hard to do, but easy to use. Also added a small microphone and and call button to make it act like a real car system.</li></ul> <br>
